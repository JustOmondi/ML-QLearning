Compiling and Running the program
---------------------------------
The program was developed in Visual Studio 2015 and has been verified to run correctly using Visual Studio 2015.

Should the program not work using Visual Studio 2013 when run as is, try running the last successful Release build, otherwise, it is recommended that Visual Studio 2015 be used to run the program.

The program may also be compiled using the Makefile by simply typing 'make' while in the main directory of the program files (Assuming that 
the appropriate make utilities have been installed on the computer being used to compile the program using 'make')

Otherwise, it is recommended that Visual Studio 2015 be used to run the program.
